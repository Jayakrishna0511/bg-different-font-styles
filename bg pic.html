    <h1>NATURE</h1>
    <p class="jay">
      Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the
      greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to
      recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
      writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation
      inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly
      valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially,
      nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air
      we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we
      gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both
      living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should
      also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature
      before it gets too late.

    <p class="ram">
      Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has
      taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. In other words, it offers
      us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of damages and
      harms. Survival of mankind without nature is impossible and humans need to
      understand that. If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also
      powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind. Every form of nature, for
      instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds
      equal significance for us. Absence of one element is enough to cause a
      catastrophe in the functioning of human life. We fulfill our healthy
      lifestyle by eating and drinking healthy, which nature gives us.
      Similarly, it provides us with water and food that enables us to do so.
      Rainfall and sunshine, the two most important elements to survive are
      derived from nature itself. Further, the air we breathe and the wood we
      use for various purposes are a gift of nature only. But, with
      technological advancements, people are not paying attention to nature. The
      need to conserve and balance the natural assets is rising day by day which
      requires immediate attention.

    <p class="abhi">
      For all of us, nature is crucial. It’s the reason for the existence of
      life on this planet. Nature is home to many different creatures. All
      living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother
      Nature. The study of the natural environment is a separate discipline of
      science. Every element has its own story to tell. Nature’s beauty is
      portrayed through the sun and moon, the plants, the flowers, etc. It is a
      common belief that reacting to something is a natural human
      characteristic. Naturally drawn characteristics are defined as genetic
      traits of an organism in sociology. The resources of nature are plentiful.
      The proper use of resources aids in the conservation of the environment.
      Natural scavengers include a variety of land and marine animals. Nature
      has provided us with a variety of ways to utilise it effectively. With the
      increasing population, the threats towards nature are increasing. With the
      growth in population, the resources are now depleting. Excessive levels of
      air and environmental pollutants add to the mix. Industrial waste,
      unrestricted vehicle use, illicit tree cutting, wildlife hunting, nuclear
      power plants, and a slew of other factors are contributing to the
      disruption of natural systems. The extinction of species as enormous as
      dinosaurs and the survival of animals as tiny as ants have been documented
      in history. It is unavoidable to remember, among other things, that nature
      can play both a protective and destructive role. Natural disasters,
      pandemics, and natural crisis scenarios have demonstrated the need for
      humans to maintain the subtle balance of nature in order to ensure the
      continuation of life on Earth for the benefit of future generations.

      Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is
      honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of
      life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements
      are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process
      natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy their
      rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and
      as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating.
      Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and
      water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to
      supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is
      unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and
      it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is
      both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic
      eruptions, floods, and cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These
      disasters, which occur as a result of natural causes, have resulted in
      significant damage. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air to our health
      cannot be overstated. Nature has a variety of beneficial effects on our
      bodies. For recuperation and vacations, people choose natural settings.
      People prefer to raise their children in the countryside in the United
      States. Their primary goal is to introduce their children to the benefits
      of natural beauty.

      Earth’s natural resources are not infinite and they cannot be replenished
      in a short period. The rapid increase in urbanization has used most of the
      resources like trees, minerals, fossil fuels, and water. Humans in their
      quest for a comfortable living have been using the resources of nature
      mindlessly. As a result, massive deforestation, resultant environmental
      pollution, wildlife destruction, and global warming are posing great
      threats to the survival of living beings. Air that gives us oxygen to
      breathe is getting polluted by smoke, industrial emissions, automobile
      exhaust, burning of fossil fuels like coal, coke and furnace oil, and use
      of certain chemicals. The garbage and wastes thrown here and there cause
      pollution of air and land. Sewage, organic wastage, industrial wastage,
      oil spillage, and chemicals pollute water. It is causing several
      water-borne diseases like cholera, jaundice and typhoid. The use of
      pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agriculture adds to soil pollution.
      Due to the mindless cutting of trees and demolition of greeneries for
      industrialization and urbanization, the ecological balance is greatly
      hampered. Deforestation causes flood and soil erosion. Earth has now
      become an ailing planet panting for care and nutrition for its
      rejuvenation. Unless mankind puts its best effort to save nature from
      these recurring situations, the Earth would turn into an unfit landmass
      for life and activity. We should check deforestation and take up the
      planting of trees at a massive rate. It will not only save the animals
      from being extinct but also help create regular rainfall and preserve soil
      fertility. We should avoid over-dependence on fossil fuels like coal,
      petroleum products, and firewood which release harmful pollutants to the
      atmosphere. Non-conventional sources of energy like the sun, biogas and
      wind should be tapped to meet our growing need for energy. It will check
      and reduce global warming. Every drop of water is vital for our survival.
      We should conserve water by its rational use, rainwater harvesting,
      checking the surface outflow, etc. industrial and domestic wastes should
      be properly treated before they are dumped into water bodies. Every
      individual can do his or her bit of responsibility to help save the nature
      around us. To build a sustainable society, every human being should
      practice in heart and soul the three R’s of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. In
      this way, we can save our nature.
